# Command line connect 4 with AI player

This is a C++ implementation of the game "Connect 4" using MiniMax for the look ahead of the AI player. The evaluation of the state is done via heuristics from Jenny Lam's report ([Heuristics in the game of Connect-K
](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jlam2/connectk.pdf)) and the coefficients were found using a genetic algorithm ([cs773c-connect4-minimax](https://github.com/TJSomething/cs773c-connect4-minimax)).
